AffineCipher
============

The AffineCipher is a generalization of the Caesar (shift) cipher. The Ceasar cipher uses a single key, with limited keyspace. The encrypted message 'e' is given by 'e = k + s mod m', where 'k' is the key, 's' is the input message, and 'm' is the size of the keyspace (= size of input space). The Affine Cipher is similar, except is uses another key 'a' such that 'e = k + s a mod m'. The reverse operation, decryption, only works when 'a' has an inverse modulo 'm'. While Affine has an improvement in the overall size of the keyspace, brute force attacks and frequency attacks are still very easy. Here I will modify my encrypt and decrypt functions for the CaesarCipher to implement the AffineCipher.

The program follows much the same layout as the shift cipher I previously implemented. The primary difference is the creation and use of a second key, increasing keyspace. Note, however, that my implementation is flawed. The relationship between time of encryption and the creation of keys opens my program up to attacks based on timing as well as frequency attacks. Ultimately, this illustrates the point that a cryptosystem can only be as strong as its implementation.
